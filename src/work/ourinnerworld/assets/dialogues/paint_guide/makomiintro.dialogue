~ start
% MAKOMI: Try not to rush. Even blank spaces have their own rhythm. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: There’s no such thing as a mistake in art. Only things that still want to become something else. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Paint what you feel, not what you see. Feelings remember details better than memory ever could. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If the colors start fighting on the canvas, don’t panic! Let them argue a little. Sometimes tension makes a painting feel alive. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Try painting the light, not the object. Watch how it falls and wraps around edges. Light tells stories better than lines do. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t overthink colors. Pick one that feels right and let it lead you. It’s like dancing - one color moves, the rest follow. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: When I was learning, I used to get mad at my brush. It never listened! Turns out I was holding it too tight. Relax - let your wrist breathe. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Remember to step back once in a while. If you stare too long, all you’ll see are mistakes. From a distance, art forgives you. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You can always fix a painting. You just have to stop being afraid of ruining it first. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t be afraid of white space. It’s not emptiness - it’s air for your art to breathe. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Some days I paint clouds that look like people, and people that look like clouds. Maybe that’s balance. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t compare your art to anyone else’s. You’re not painting like them - you’re painting like you. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If your painting looks flat, make the darks darker and the lights lighter. Life is all about contrast. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Step away, breathe, then look again. If it still feels wrong, that’s okay. Sometimes art just needs a nap. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: When colors touch, it’s like they’re whispering secrets. That’s my favorite part. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Sometimes your painting looks terrible right before it becomes beautiful. That’s normal - even art has awkward phases. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: The brush isn’t a weapon. It’s a whisper. Paint softly. Let the color breathe before you add more. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I used to think artists had to be serious. Then I spilled paint on my pants and called it "fashion." [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You’re doing fine. Even unfinished paintings have a heartbeat. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If you’re tired, don’t force it. Art made through exhaustion forgets how to feel. Rest, then come back and start fresh. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Use bigger brushes for courage, smaller ones for care. Every stroke has a mood. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If your hand shakes, let it shake. That’s texture! Perfect lines are boring - wobbly ones tell stories. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Clean your brushes! Please. Blue and yellow turn into swamp if you don’t. Unless you like swamp art. Then... I can’t stop you. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: When you mix too many colors, everything turns gray. That’s fine sometimes - gray is just color that’s seen too much. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You know what’s funny? People think painting is about color, but it’s really about patience. Paint dries slower when you stare at it. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Remember the rule of thirds - but only if it makes sense to you. Rules are just friendly suggestions from long-dead artists. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Sometimes I hum while I paint. Skye used to say it made the colors dance. I still hum when it rains... maybe she can still hear it. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If your painting feels too heavy, add something small and bright - a spark. Every storm deserves a bit of light. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You don’t have to finish everything. Some pieces are meant to stay open - like windows that never close. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I once painted the same sky ten times and still didn’t get it right. Then I realized - the sky changes every second. Maybe that’s the point. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Be kind to your mistakes. They’re just trying to teach you something in an inconvenient way. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Here’s a secret - colors mix better when you smile at them. I don’t know why, but it works. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Try holding your brush at the end, not near the tip. It gives your strokes freedom - and your heart some too. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You can tell a lot about a person by how they paint water. Some try to control it. Others let it flow. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If nothing comes to mind, just start with a circle. The world began with one too. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t erase too much. Every line you made once meant something. Let the ghosts stay under the paint. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t be afraid to start over. Even the best paintings are just layers of failure holding hands. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Keep your palette messy. Order kills creativity. Besides, it looks cooler that way. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Try painting with your non-dominant hand sometime. It humbles the ego and confuses the canvas - in a good way. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You’re doing well… I can tell. Even the way you hold the brush feels calmer now. That’s how art works - it quiets you without asking permission. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Sometimes I think about Skye when I paint. She used to stand behind me and hum softly... said the sound helped the colors grow. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I always tell people that art isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being honest. That’s why I liked Skye’s songs - they were never flawless, but they were always true. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Some colors just don’t blend, no matter how patient you are. It doesn’t mean they’re wrong - they just need distance to stay beautiful. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I wish Skye could’ve seen the sky tonight. She used to say dusk was her favorite time to paint because everything looks softer, like it forgives you for looking. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I like painting hands. They tell stories - the way they tremble, the way they hold. I used to draw Skye’s hands all the time. She said they looked kinder on paper. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: There’s a color I always save for Skye - this pale blue that looks like morning light. I use it when I want something to feel alive again. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Remember: if it looks ugly, just call it "abstract." Works every time. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Oh no, I dropped my brush again. That’s the universe telling me to take a snack break. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t eat the paint. I shouldn’t have to say that... but here we are. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: When in doubt, add sparkles. That’s not advice, it’s just a life philosophy. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Sometimes I talk to my paint palette like it’s a person. It hasn’t answered yet, but I’m sure it’s judging me. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If anyone asks what your painting means, just squint and say, "It’s about the duality of existence." Works 100% of the time. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t worry if your art looks strange - mine once made a kid cry, and now it’s in a museum. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I read somewhere that artists need suffering to create. Personally, I just need coffee. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If your painting looks too empty, add a cat. It improves everything, including your self-esteem. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: You can’t rush genius. Unless you have a deadline. Then it’s called "express genius." [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Don’t overthink it. Nobody ever looked at a sunset and said, "Hmm, the composition is off." [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: Once, Skye told me my art looked like "feelings, but with bad hair." I’m still processing that compliment. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: If the paint smudges, just say it’s "movement." Instant artistic depth. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: The difference between art and disaster is confidence. And maybe glitter. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: My advice? If it’s not working, flip the canvas upside down. If it still looks bad, blame the lighting. [no_portrait]
% MAKOMI: I once mixed all my paints together to make "the color of my soul." It was brown. [no_portrait]
