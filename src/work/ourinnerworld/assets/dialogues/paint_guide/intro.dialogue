MAKOMI: So... you’ve never really painted before, huh? That’s okay. Everyone starts with a blank canvas - it’s not as scary as it looks. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: The trick is not to think too much. Just let your hand move. The canvas isn’t judging you... it’s waiting to meet you. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: Don’t worry about what it’s supposed to look like. Worry about how it feels while you do it. The feeling is what stays. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: Art isn’t about creating something perfect always. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: You can use any color you want. Just remember, colors are like emotions - they don’t always get along, but they still belong on the same canvas. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: Let's try with this! [no_portrait]
