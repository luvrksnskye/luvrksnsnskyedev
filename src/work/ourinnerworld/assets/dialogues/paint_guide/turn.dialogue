MAKOMI: ... There. My snowman’s done. Not perfect, but he’s trying. I think that’s enough. [no_portrait]
AKOMI: I like snowmen. They don’t last forever, but they make the cold feel less lonely for a while. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: SKYE used to build them with her bare hands, even when it hurt from the cold. She said it was worth it if they could smile back. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: See, RAINY? Painting isn’t about precision. It’s about care. Even the smallest shapes can hold warmth. [no_portrait]
MAKOMI: Take your time. The world isn’t going anywhere and neither am I. [no_portrait]
