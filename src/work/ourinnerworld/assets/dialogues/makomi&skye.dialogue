NONE: ...
NONE: They look so peaceful together.
NONE: For a moment, you forget everything else.
NONE: Their laughter feels like sunlight you haven’t felt in years.
NONE: It makes you smile, not out of joy, but out of relief.
NONE: Like maybe... you did something right once.
NONE: ...
NONE: They’re in their own little world.
NONE: Maybe that’s how it should be.
NONE: You should let them stay there... safe, and happy.
NONE: Maybe this is how they were before everything changed.
NONE: Before the noise, before the snow.
NONE: ...
NONE: You wonder if they ever think about you, wherever they are now.
NONE: The thought hurts... but it’s a gentle kind of pain.
NONE: You decide not to interrupt them.
NONE: Just this once, you’ll let the past stay peaceful.
NONE: The train moves on, and so do you.
