NONE: You slowly close your eyes.
NONE: The rhythm of the train feels slower now.
NONE: Like it’s breathing with you.
NONE: The stars outside the window look closer than they should.
NONE: They fade in and out - like someone’s memory trying not to disappear.
NONE: You feel light, almost weightles...
NONE: like you’re leaving something behind.
NONE: The world grows quiet.
NONE: Too quiet.
NONE: You wonder... if peace is supposed to feel this lonely.
NONE: The train keeps moving, but you’re no longer sure you are.
NONE: Slowly... everything fades.
