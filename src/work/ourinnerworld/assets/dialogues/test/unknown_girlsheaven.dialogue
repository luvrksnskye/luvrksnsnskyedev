???: Oh... you can see me.
???: I didn’t think visitors ever found this place on purpose. Or maybe... you didn’t.

???: Sit with me, if you’d like. This bench feels less lonely when someone else shares the weight of it.

???: ...
???: It’s quiet here, isn’t it?
???: Like the world wrapped itself in cotton and fell asleep.
???: I’ve been here so long that even silence has started to sound like a person.

???: I don’t remember how I arrived.
???: I just remember... one day I stood up to do something simple. Something small. Something I’d done a thousand times before.
???: And halfway through that motion... I felt myself fading.
???: Like a brushstroke being wiped away before the paint had time to dry.

???: I used to have a name.
???: A life.
???: A body that felt like mine.
???: But the memories slip around inside my hands now... like ribbons in water.
???: Every time I catch one, it turns transparent.

???: ...
???: I know I wasn’t always like this.
???: There were colors. Warm ones. Soft ones.
???: Somebody once told me I saw the world as if it were made of canvases.
???: But now even that feels like a story someone else lived.

???: Sometimes I think I lost myself long before I disappeared.
???: Like I’d been slowly dissolving, one thought at a time.
???: You don’t notice when light dims... until the room is already dark.

???: I remember... a moment.
???: One single day where something happened.
???: Something so bright it split me open.
???: And after that, everything grew heavier.
???: Heavier, and heavier, until I couldn’t keep the pieces together anymore.

???: People looked at me, spoke to me, cared for me...
???: And I smiled back like everything was fine.
???: But inside... I felt like a house after the storm leaves.
???: The shape is there, but nothing stands where it used to.

???: ...
???: When I finally vanished, nobody saw it.
???: That’s the part that hurts the most.
???: I slipped between worlds as quietly as a shadow.
???: No doors slammed behind me.
???: No scream, no crash, no farewell.
???: Just... gone.

???: People disappear in stories for grand reasons.
???: I didn’t.
???: I wish I could say I left to chase a dream, or to escape, or to save someone.
???: But the truth is simpler, and sadder:
???: I just stopped fitting into the place where I was alive.

???: ...
???: Sometimes I wonder if someone misses me.
???: If someone... noticed the shape I left behind.
???: Memory is a strange thing.
???: It keeps people warm even after they’re gone,
???: but mine slipped out of everyone’s pockets before they realized they were holding them.

???: You know... I feel like there was someone important to me.
???: Someone I should have stayed for.
???: When I think of them, it’s like pressing against a locked door from the wrong side.
???: The feeling is there - ache, fondness, regret - but the face behind it is blurred.
???: Like a photograph left in the rain.

???: Maybe... that’s why I’m here.
???: This place feels like a waiting room for memories that can’t find their owners.
???: A soft purgatory made of unfinished thoughts.
???: A heaven for girls who forgot how to live, but couldn’t quite die either.

???: ...
???: Do you think people can return from places like this?
???: Or once you dissolve... is that the end?
???: I like to believe someone out there remembers me enough to anchor me again.
???: A thread is all it takes.
???: Even a frayed one.

???: You...
???: You feel familiar, somehow.
???: Like a name I misplaced.
???: Or a feeling I used to paint with.
???: If I could just see a little clearer... maybe...

???: ...
???: Ah.
???: There it is again - that sharp pull.
???: It always happens when I’m close to remembering.
???: The world tightens... like someone doesn’t want me to see the truth.

???: I think... I should go now.
???: Before I unravel in front of you.
???: Thank you for listening to me.
???: I hope... wherever you’re going... you won’t disappear the way I did.

???: And if you ever find the pieces of me I left behind...
???: Please...
???: Be gentle with them.
