HIKORI: ...?

RAINY: I'm sorry.  [#emotion=sad] 

HIKORI: ...

HIKORI: So... everything that happened to me... all that time ago... was because of you?

RAINY: ...  [#emotion=crying] 

HIKORI: The time I was alone, stranded here, growing cold... all the things I did to survive...

HIKORI: ...

HIKORI: Don't worry about it! Best friends forgive each other, no matter what happens!

RAINY: ... Really?  [#emotion=worried] 

HIKORI: Of course! I cherish you, DREAMER, and I know you only did those things because you were scared and in pain! Plus... being YOU would change you.

HIKORI: You threw away all your feelings. Of course you wouldn't know how to be guilty! And with this being a dream, you wouldn't take it seriously anyway.

HIKORI: You didn’t think I was real, so it only makes sense you treated me that way.

RAINY: ...  [#emotion=sad] 

HIKORI: It's different now. Now you're here in THE NEW NEIGHBORHOOD, so clearly BLOOM ISLAND didn't work out. You're here to make it up to me!

HIKORI: It also means you're just as lost as I was when I first fell down, and… you need my help.

RAINY: ...  [#emotion=sad] 

HIKORI: Don't worry, DREAMER. I'll take care of everything. I'll help you. We're going to be so happy together.


RAINY: ... Thanks.  [#emotion=smile] 

HIKORI: No need to thank me! Here, why don't you make yourself comfortable? I just need to block off the stump real quick...

RAINY: Why?  [#emotion=worried] 

HIKORI: Why? Well... I don't want that other HIKIKO barging down here. It's our home, and he's not welcome.

RAINY: ...?  [#emotion=worried] 

HIKORI: ...

HIKORI: ... You still want... a different HIKIKO?

HIKORI: Even after I decided to forgive you... because you finally chose me over all those other replacements you made?

HIKORI: What did he call you again? RAINY? Is that your real name, DREAMER? Are you two really that close? Am I really that unwanted?

HIKORI: [shake rate=20 level=10]A year of miserable loneliness... waiting until the day I would see YOU again and make sure you would never replace me again...[/shake]

HIKORI: [shake rate=20 level=10]DID YOU COME DOWN HERE JUST TO MAKE ME SUFFER!? GIVE ME FALSE HOPE!? I JUST WANTED TO BE YOUR HIKIKO AGAIN! ISN'T THAT WHY YOU SAID "SORRY"!?[/shake]

HIKORI: [shake rate=20 level=10]DID YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD FORGIVE YOU THAT EASILY!? YOU'RE HORRIBLE! YOU TRIED TO KILL ME SO MANY TIMES, AND YOU WON'T EVEN GIVE ME YOUR TIME!?[/shake]

HIKORI: [shake rate=20 level=10]You know what's funny? For a second, I thought you changed. But SOMETHING always gets in the way of us and I suffer all alone.[/shake]

HIKORI: I won't anymore. I'm the only HIKIKO you'll ever need.

HIKORI: [shake rate=20 level=10]Do you see what you've done to me, RAINY?[/shake]
