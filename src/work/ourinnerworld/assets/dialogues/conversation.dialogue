???: I've been here for a long time. It's quiet and peaceful... and there is nothing I have to do. I can sit here and rest as long as I like.
???: There was never a time that I didn't want that. My greatest wish... has always been to rest.
???: ...
???: I'm very, very tired.
???: I haven't done anything that would earn this fatigue. It simply exists, and has always existed.
???: It will continue to exist as long as I live, weighing down my body and my mind.
???: Certainly, it could be so much worse. I'm lucky that I can sit here and stare at this beautiful sky. I'm lucky that I can rest as much as I need to.
???: I know that so many cannot. So many must push through and endure, no matter how hard it is or how much it hurts. They have to, because they want to live. Because one day... Maybe... they will get to rest.
???: One day, they'll be able to join me here and stare at the moon, too. It doesn't need to be night to sleep. It doesn't need to be any particular time at all.
???: I'm very, very lucky. Yet...
???: I sit here, wondering what life would be like if the weariness left my bones. If sleep truly took away exhaustion. If any amount of rest healed me and gave me energy.
???: Right now, all I can do is exist. All the energy I muster... goes into taking another breath.
???: I look to tomorrow, to the next day, and wonder how everyone else can do so much while I sit, incapable of anything but rest that brings no benefit.
???: I tried to fix it. I did everything I could.
???: Nothing ever worked. I merely grew more and more miserable, more helpless, wondering if this was how I would feel forever.
???: And it turns out... the answer is yes.
???: I will feel this way forever. It will only get worse as I age. I can't fix it.
???: ...
???: You're young. You have a lot ahead of you. I can see in your eyes the same exhaustion that is in mine. I can see the way you move slowly, conserving what little energy you have.
???: I see you pushing yourself, refusing to accept a weak self, going beyond what is healthy...
???: And I see you collapsing, comatose, as a consequence for that desperate goal.
???: To be cured...
???: There is only getting better. Not everything can be cured. And while it can be so much worse, reality remains.
???: Not everyone feels this way. Nobody will understand the true meaning of fatigue except us, and people like us.
???: The only thing we can do is endure.
???: I'd like to tell you to find support... to find people to help you as you live with this condition.
???: But not everyone has people in their life that will accept this.
???: Some days are better, some days are worse... But there will never be a day where you don't feel the weight in your bones.
???: The taxing nature of our existence continues, and we live despite it.
???: It's morning now.
???: We've already awoken.
???: If only... it were easier to get up.
???: When you go back to your efforts, to whatever you were doing before this...
???: Maybe allow yourself some grace.
???: Everyone has their limits. You have to accept yours eventually.
???: Or else, in your efforts to be like everyone else... you will only hurt yourself.
???: And that, too, will make the people around you sad.
???: It's hard, isn't it?
???: Don't worry. At least for now... you can sit here and look at the moon.
???: Mm... Yes, I think that's what I will do, too. I think it's okay if I leave now.
???: I hope you won't mind... if I finally rest.
???: Don't push yourself too hard out there. Living... is a fine accomplishment already.
???: ...
???: You know... this weariness... it wasn't always this heavy. She used to make it lighter. Just by being there.
???: She was my little child. A tiny, messy patchwork of black and amber and gold, like a stained-glass window shattered and remade into a perfect, living thing. 
???: Her fur was never sleek, always sticking out in every direction, especially after a nap. She looked like a little storm cloud that had learned how to purr.
???: She had these eyes... ancient and green, like moss on a stone. She'd look at me, and it was like she could see straight through the tiredness, right down to the person I used to be.
???: She wasn't a graceful creature. She was clumsy. She'd try to jump onto the windowsill to watch the birds and miss, tumbling into a flustered, offended little puffball. 
???: She'd chirp at sparrows, her tail twitching, a tiny hunter with no concept of glass. Her purr was a ragged, rumbling thing, loud and inelegant, and it was the most beautiful sound I've ever known.
???: She'd sleep right here, curled in the hollow of my stomach, a warm, heavy, purring blanket. That was the only time the ache in my bones felt still. She was my anchor.
???: I loved her. Not in a simple "pet" way. 
???: I loved her chaotic, imperfect soul. I loved her stubbornness, the way she'd gently bite my finger if I stopped petting her, the way she'd bring me her favorite toy-a crumpled piece of paper-like it was a great treasure.
???: And I failed her.
???: It was so... ordinary. Something so mundane, so brutal. One moment she was there, a vibrant, clumsy little masterpiece of life. The next... just stillness. The silence she left behind was a physical thing. It's a hole in the world, shaped exactly like her.
???: This fatigue now... it's the weight of that silence. It's the energy it takes to breathe in a world that no longer has her in it. It's the effort of remembering the exact pattern of the tortoiseshell patch on her nose, and being terrified that one day I might forget.
???: I'm not just tired of my own life. I'm tired of living in a world that took her away. All this love I still have for her... it has nowhere to go. It just sits in my chest, heavy and useless.
???: So this rest... it's not surrender. It's a journey. I'm going to find her. I have to believe she's waiting somewhere, in some sunbeam just beyond my sight, her fur sticking up in every direction, ready to give me that clumsy, judgmental chirp for taking so long.
???: So, little one... if you are ever loved by a creature, a messy, perfect, real creature... hold them close. Their time is a fleeting gift. Their absence is a forever winter.
???: Oh. Now... look. The moon is out. It reminds me of the white speck on her chest, a little star on her dark fur.
???: I think it's time. I'm going to go find my little storm cloud. I'm going to go home.
???: Goodbye, RAINY.
