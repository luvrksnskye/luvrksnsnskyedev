STRANGER: How are you feeling? [#emotion=relaxed] 

RAINY: ...? [#emotion=worried] 

STRANGER: Are you comfortable in your vessel? Have there been any issues? It took some time for me to adapt to mine... [#emotion=neutral] 

STRANGER: The little ones this body is made of are partially to blame. But still, I wanted to make sure you weren't in distress. [#emotion=sad] 

RAINY: [wait=1] It's fine. [#emotion=question] 

STRANGER: That's a relief, then. [#emotion=neutral] 

STRANGER: You know, I... I wanted to guide you earlier, back up in BLOOM ISLAND. I wasn't able to leave a trail like I could in the past, not without catching the attention of... [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: ... [#emotion=relaxed] 

STRANGER: RAINY, can I be honest with you? [#emotion=neutral] 

RAINY: ... [#emotion=worried] 

STRANGER: There's SOMETHING I need to warn you about, but I worry if I do, it'll scare you. It'll prevent you from acting natural up above. [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: Our goal will be in danger. If this place is found... those in BLOOM ISLAND, or even BLACK SPACE, may try to come down. [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: The worst case scenario is our journey being impeded. And if they already know that you won’t stay no matter what, the residents might turn to drastic action. We can’t have that. [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: The biggest danger... the person who has the most influence and power, and will do anything to get in your way... [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: I... I can’t remember their name. What... did they look like. [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: ... [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: As much as I'd like this to be your last dream, that's probably impossible. So pretend that you don't know this place exists, pretend I'm not here, and... [#emotion=sad] 

STRANGER: Keep whoever is left in BLOOM ISLAND happy while you find your way back to HOME. They want you to love dreaming, so they won’t hurt you. [#emotion=neutral] 

STRANGER: At least... not on purpose. So don't let them know what you're doing, and stay focused and alert. [#emotion=neutral] 

STRANGER: Some things aren't yours anymore. [#emotion=doubtful] 

RAINY: ... [#emotion=worried] 

NONE: You will remember her words.

STRANGER: Next time we take a breather, I'll try to keep the topic on less stressful things, and simply enjoy the scenery... [#emotion=neutral] 

STRANGER: It’d be nice to have regular conversations with you. I've never been able to do that before. I look forward to it. [#emotion=neutral] 

RAINY: ... [#emotion=sad]
